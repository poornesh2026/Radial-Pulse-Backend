## Principles

- **No fake auth.** Tests sign real JWTs with a test RSA key; the production verifier checks them.
- **No real third-party accounts.** S3 and Cognito userInfo are replaced through FastAPI
  dependency overrides with small in-memory doubles (`tests/conftest.py`). Google, Meta,
  etc. integrations will get recorded fixtures, never live calls in CI.
- **PostgreSQL is the truth.** SQLite is only the fast local path; CI runs the full suite
  on PostgreSQL 16, with the schema built by the real Alembic migrations.
- **Every new clinic-scoped route** gets a line in `test_tenant_isolation.py`.
- Test data comes from `tests/factories.py` — never from production.
- On PostgreSQL the app under test connects as a member of `radial_app`, so RLS is really
  enforced; test setup (`db` fixture) uses the owner connection.
- **Risk-based**: the heaviest tests sit where a bug is most expensive — tenant isolation,
  RLS, permissions, migrations of stored data, job retries/idempotency, evidence rules.
  Simple CRUD gets one happy path and one access test.
