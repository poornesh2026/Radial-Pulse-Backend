"""Platform-wide enumerations.

THE SOURCE OF TRUTH for these values. They are exported to OpenAPI (as named
schemas) in openapi/openapi.json; the frontend generates its TypeScript types from
that file, so a change here reaches the screens through a new contract release.
Add values freely; renaming or removing a value needs a data migration and a
coordinated frontend change.

Stored in the database as plain strings (``native_enum=False``) so adding a value
never needs an ``ALTER TYPE``.
